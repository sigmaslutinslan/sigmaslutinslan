If you’re in need of fast cash to cover an unexpected expense like a car repair or medical bill, you may consider payday loans online. A payday loan is a small dollar loan you must pay back on your next payday, usually within two to four weeks.

While you can take out an online payday loan from a lender quickly and easily, this financing option can be very expensive. Payday loans online often come with exorbitant interest rates and fees that make repayment a real challenge.

Unless you pay them back in full and on time, they can steer you into a cycle of debt, damage your credit score, and warrant the need for credit counseling. That’s why our experts have compiled this list of the best alternatives to payday loans online.
